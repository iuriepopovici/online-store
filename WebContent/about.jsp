      <h3>Paula's Porcupine Pagoda</h3>
      <p>Paula’s Porcupine Pagoda is an Acupuncture 
      Salon located inside a traditional Japanese Pagoda. 
      Paula Johnson is our founder. 
      In 1992, Paula’s home was devastated by the flood that affected the greater woodland area. 
      However, while looking for a new home for herself, 
      she realized hundreds of porcupines in the area had been displaced. 
      She decided to help them. She founded this salon in 1993. We help people get rid of pain, 
      but we also sell porcupine themed merchandise to our customers. 
      All proceedings go to helping an endangered species of porcupine, 
      called Erethizon Dorsatum. </p>
